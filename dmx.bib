  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose Database Processing Units, or DPUs, a class of domain-specific database processors that can efficiently handle database applications. As a proof of concept, we present the instruction set architecture, microarchitecture, and hardware implementation of one DPU, called Q100. The Q100 has a collection of heterogeneous ASIC tiles that process relational tables and columns quickly and energy-efficiently. The architecture uses coarse grained in- structions that manipulate streams of data, thereby maximizing pipeline and data parallelism, and minimizing the need to time multiplex the accelerator tiles and spill inter- mediate results to memory. This work explores a Q100 de- sign space of 150 configurations, selecting three for further analysis: a small, power-conscious implementation, a high- performance implementation, and a balanced design that maximizes performance per Watt. We then demonstrate that the power-conscious Q100 handles the TPC-H queries with three orders of magnitude less energy than a state of the art software DBMS, while the performance-oriented design out- performs the same DBMS by 70X.},

  abstract  = {The explosive growth in digital data and its growing role in real-time decision support motivate the design of high-performance database management systems (DBMSs). Meanwhile, slowdown in supply voltage scaling has stymied improvements in core performance and ushered an era of power-limited chips. These developments motivate the design of DBMS accelerators that (a) maximize utility by accelerating the dominant operations, and (b) provide flexibility in the choice of DBMS, data layout, and data types.We study data analytics workloads on contemporary in-memory databases and find hash index lookups to be the largest single contributor to the overall execution time. The critical path in hash index lookups consists of ALU-intensive key hashing followed by pointer chasing through a node list. Based on these observations, we introduce Widx, an on-chip accelerator for database hash index lookups, which achieves both high performance and flexibility by (1) decoupling key hashing from the list traversal, and (2) processing multiple keys in parallel on a set of programmable walker units. Widx reduces design cost and complexity through its tight integration with a conventional core, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated TLB and cache. An evaluation of Widx on a set of modern data analytics workloads (TPC-H, TPC-DS) using full-system simulation shows an average speedup of 3.1x over an aggressive OoO core on bulk hash table operations, while reducing the OoO core energy by 83\%.},

  optabstract = {Programmable network hardware can run services traditionally deployed on servers, resulting in orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance. Yet, despite these performance improvements, network operators remain skeptical of in-network computing. The conventional wisdom is that the operational costs from increased power consumption outweigh any performance benefits. Unless in-network computing can justify its costs, it will be disregarded as yet another academic exercise.In this paper, we challenge that assumption, by providing a detailed power analysis of several in-network computing use cases. Our experiments show that in-network computing can be extremely power-efficient. In fact, for a single watt, a software system on commodity CPU can be improved by a factor of x100 using an FPGA, and a factor of x1000 utilizing ASIC implementations. However, this efficiency depends on the system load. To address changing workloads, we propose in-network computing on demand, where services can be dynamically moved between servers and the network. By shifting the placement of services on-demand, data centers can optimize for both performance and power efficiency.},

This raises a fundamental question: what kinds of computation should be delegated to the network?In this paper, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for co-designing data center distributed systems with their network layer. We believe that the time has finally come for offloading part of their computation to execute in-network. However, in-network computation tasks must be judiciously crafted to match the limitations of the network machine architecture of programmable devices. With the help of our experiments on machine learning and graph analytics workloads, we identify that aggregation functions raise opportunities to exploit the limited computation power of networking hardware to lessen network congestion and improve the overall application performance. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, we propose Daiet, a system that performs in-network data aggregation. Experimental results with an initial prototype show a large data reduction ratio (86.9\%-89.3\%) and a similar decrease in the workers' computation time.},

  optabstract = {We present dRMT (disaggregated Reconfigurable Match-Action Table), a new architecture for programmable switches. dRMT overcomes two important restrictions of RMT, the predominant pipeline-based architecture for programmable switches: (1) table memory is local to an RMT pipeline stage, implying that memory not used by one stage cannot be reclaimed by another, and (2) RMT is hardwired to always sequentially execute matches followed by actions as packets traverse pipeline stages. We show that these restrictions make it difficult to execute programs efficiently on RMT.dRMT resolves both issues by disaggregating the memory and compute resources of a programmable switch. Specifically, dRMT moves table memories out of pipeline stages and into a centralized pool that is accessible through a crossbar. In addition, dRMT replaces RMT's pipeline stages with a cluster of processors that can execute match and action operations in any order.We show how to schedule a P4 program on dRMT at compile time to guarantee deterministic throughput and latency. We also present a hardware design for dRMT and analyze its feasibility and chip area. Our results show that dRMT can run programs at line rate with fewer processors compared to RMT, and avoids performance cliffs when there are not enough processors to run a program at line rate. dRMT's hardware design incurs a modest increase in chip area relative to RMT, mainly due to the crossbar.},

  optabstract = {In Software Defined Networking (SDN) the control plane is physically separate from the forwarding plane. Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ``Match-Action'' processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.},

Whereas device density historically doubled every 18--24 months, the rate of recent silicon process advancements has declined. While improvements in device scaling continue, albeit at a reduced pace, the industry is simultaneously observing increases in manufacturing costs.In response, the industry is now seeing a trend toward reversing direction on the traditional march toward more integration. Instead, multiple industry and academic groups are advocating that systems on chips (SoCs) be "disintegrated" into multiple smaller "chiplets." This paper details the technology challenges that motivated AMD to use chiplets, the technical solutions we developed for our products, and how we expanded the use of chiplets from individual processors to multiple product families.},

  optabstract = {IBM Telum is the next generation processor chip for IBM Z and LinuxONE systems. The Telum design is focused on enterprise class workloads and it achieves over 40\% per socket performance growth compared to IBM z15. The IBM Telum is the first server-class chip with a dedicated on-chip AI accelerator that enables clients to gain real time insights from their data as it is getting processed.Seamlessly infusing AI in all enterprise workloads is highly desirable to get real business insight on every transaction as well as to improve IT operation, security, and data privacy. While it would undeniably provide significant additional value, its application in practice is often accompanied by hurdles from low throughput if run on-platform to security concerns and inconsistent latency if run off-platform. The IBM Telum chip introduces an on-chip AI accelerator that provides consistent low latency and high throughput (over 200 TFLOPS in 32 chip system) inference capacity usable by all threads. The accelerator is memory coherent and directly connected to the fabric like any other general-purpose core to support low latency inference while meeting the system's transaction rate. A scalable architecture providing transparent access to AI accelerator functions via a non-privileged general-purpose core instruction further reduces software orchestration and library complexity as well as provides extensibility to the AI functions. On a global bank customer credit card fraud detection model, the AI accelerator achieves 22\texttimes{} speed up in latency compared to a general purpose core utilizing vector execution units. For the same model, the AI accelerator achieves 116k inferences every second with a latency of only 1.1 msec. As the system is scaled up from one chip to 32 chips, it performs more than 3.5 Million inferences/sec and the latency still stays very low at only 1.2 msec.This paper briefly introduces the IBM Telum chip and later describes the integrated AI accelerator. IBM Telum's AI accelerator architecture, microarchitecture, integration into the system stack, performance, and power are covered in detail.},

At the same time, the slowdown in Moore's law is leading the industry to embrace custom computing in large-scale systems. Taken together, these trends motivate the need to characterize live production traffic on these large data processing platforms and understand the opportunity of acceleration at scale.This paper addresses this key need. We characterize three important production distributed database and data analytics platforms at Google to identify key hardware acceleration opportunities and perform a comprehensive limits study to understand the trade-offs among various hardware acceleration strategies.We observe that hyperscale data processing platforms spend significant time on distributed storage and other remote work across distributed workers. Therefore, optimizing storage and remote work in addition to compute acceleration is critical for these platforms. We present a detailed breakdown of the compute-intensive functions in these platforms and identify dominant key data operations related to datacenter and systems taxes. We observe that no single accelerator can provide a significant benefit but collectively, a sea of accelerators, can accelerate many of these smaller platform-specific functions. We demonstrate the potential gains of the sea of accelerators proposal in a limits study and analytical model. We perform a comprehensive study to understand the trade-offs between accelerator location (on-chip/off-chip) and invocation model (synchronous/asynchronous). We propose and evaluate a chained accelerator execution model where identified compute-intensive functions are accelerated and pipelined to avoid invocation from the core, achieving a 3x improvement over the baseline system while nearly matching identical performance to an ideal fully asynchronous execution model.},

  optabstract = {Cloud providers widely deploy FPGAs as application-specific accelerators for customer use. These providers seek to multiplex their FPGAs among customers via virtualization, thereby reducing running costs. Unfortunately, most virtualization support is confined to FPGAs that expose a restrictive, host-centric programming model in which accelerators cannot issue direct memory accesses (DMAs). The host-centric model incurs high runtime overhead for workloads that exhibit pointer chasing. Thus, FPGAs are beginning to support a shared-memory programming model in which accelerators can issue DMAs. However, virtualization support for shared-memory FPGAs is limited. This paper presents Optimus, the first hypervisor that supports scalable shared-memory FPGA virtualization. Optimus offers both spatial multiplexing and temporal multiplexing to provide efficient and flexible sharing of each accelerator on an FPGA. To share the FPGA-CPU interconnect at a high clock frequency, Optimus implements a multiplexer tree. To isolate each guest's address space, Optimus introduces the technique of page table slicing as a hardware-software co-design. To support preemptive temporal multiplexing, Optimus provides an accelerator preemption interface. We show that Optimus supports eight physical accelerators on a single FPGA and improves the aggregate throughput of twelve real-world benchmarks by 1.98x-7x.}

  optabstract = {Conventional servers have achieved high performance by employing fast CPUs to run compute-intensive workloads, while making operating systems manage relatively slow I/O devices through memory accesses and interrupts. However, as the emerging workloads are becoming heavily data-intensive and the emerging devices (e.g., NVM storage, high-bandwidth NICs, and GPUs) come to enable low-latency and high-bandwidth device operations, the traditional host-centric server architectures fail to deliver high performance due to their inefficient device handling mechanisms. Furthermore, without resolving the architecture inefficiency, the performance loss will continue to increase as the emerging devices become faster.In this paper, we propose DCS, a novel device-centric server architecture to fully exploit the potential of the emerging devices so that the server performance nicely scales with the performance of the devices. The key idea of DCS is to orchestrate the devices to directly communicate with each other while selectively bypassing the host. The host becomes responsible for only few device-related operations (e.g., filesystem lookup). In this way, DCS achieves high I/O performance by direct inter-device communications and high computation performance by fully utilizing the host-side resources. To implement DCS, we introduce DCS Engine, a custom hardware device to orchestrate devices via standard I/O protocols (i.e., PCIe and NVMe), along with its device driver and user-level library. We show that our FPGA-based DCS prototype significantly improves the performance of emerging server workloads and the architecture will nicely scale with the performance of the devices.}

HPRCs have been shown to provide good speedups and good cost/performance ratios, but not necessarily ease of use, leading to a slow acceptance of this technology. HPRCs introduce new design challenges, such as the lack of portability across platforms, incompatibilities with legacy code, users reluctant to change their code base, a prolonged learning curve, and the need for a system-level Hardware/Software co-design development flow. This article presents the evolution and current work on TMD-MPI, which started as an MPI-based programming model for Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip implemented in FPGAs, and has now evolved to include multiple X86 processors. TMD-MPI is shown to address current design challenges in HPRC usage, suggesting that the MPI standard has enough syntax and semantics to program these new types of parallel architectures. Also presented is the TMD-MPI Ecosystem, which consists of research projects and tools that are developed around TMD-MPI to further improve HPRC usability. Finally, we present preliminary communication performance measurements.}

The fundamental issue is that of a mismatch between the diversity of user code and the functionality of fixed hardware, limiting its wider uptake. Here we focus on a particular set of accelerators: those for Fast Fourier Transforms. We present FACC (Fourier ACcelerator Compiler), a novel approach to automatically map legacy code to Fourier Transform accelerators. It automatically generates drop-in replacement adapters using Input-Output (IO)-based program synthesis that bridge the gap between user code and accelerators. We apply FACC to unmodified GitHub C programs of varying complexity and compare against two existing approaches. We target FACC to a high-performance library, FFTW, and two hardware accelerators, the NXP PowerQuad and the Analog Devices FFTA, and demonstrate mean speedups of 9x, 17x and 27x respectively}

  optabstract = {CPUs routinely offload to NICs network-related processing tasks like packet segmentation and checksum. NIC offloads are advantageous because they free valuable CPU cycles. But their applicability is typically limited to layer≤4 protocols (TCP and lower), and they are inapplicable to layer-5 protocols (L5Ps) that are built on top of TCP. This limitation is caused by a misfeature we call ”offload dependence,” which dictates that L5P offloading additionally requires offloading the underlying layer≤4 protocols and related functionality: TCP, IP, firewall, etc. The dependence of L5P offloading hinders innovation, because it implies hard-wiring the complicated, ever-changing implementation of the lower-level protocols. We propose ”autonomous NIC offloads,” which eliminate offload dependence. Autonomous offloads provide a lightweight software-device architecture that accelerates L5Ps without having to migrate the entire layer≤4 TCP/IP stack into the NIC. A main challenge that autonomous offloads address is coping with out-of-sequence packets. We implement autonomous offloads for two L5Ps: (i) NVMe-over-TCP zero-copy and CRC computation, and (ii) https authentication, encryption, and decryption. Our autonomous offloads increase throughput by up to 3.3x, and they deliver CPU consumption and latency that are as low as 0.4x and 0.7x, respectively. Their implementation is already upstreamed in the Linux kernel, and they will be supported in the next-generation of Mellanox NICs.}

  optabstract = {Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables the secure offloading of computations to the cloud by providing computation on encrypted data (ciphertexts). HE is based on noisy encryption schemes in which noise accumulates as more computations are applied to the data. The limited number of operations applicable to the data prevents practical applications from exploiting HE. Bootstrapping enables an unlimited number of operations or fully HE (FHE) by refreshing the ciphertext. Unfortunately, bootstrapping requires a significant amount of additional computation and memory bandwidth as well. Prior works have proposed hardware accelerators for computation primitives of FHE. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first to propose a hardware FHE accelerator that supports bootstrapping as a first-class citizen.In particular, we propose BTS --- Bootstrappable, Technology-driven, Secure accelerator architecture for FHE. We identify the challenges of supporting bootstrapping in the accelerator and analyze the off-chip memory bandwidth and computation required. In particular, given the limitations of modern memory technology, we identify the HE parameter sets that are efficient for FHE acceleration. Based on the insights gained from our analysis, we propose BTS, which effectively exploits the parallelism innate in HE operations by arranging a massive number of processing elements in a grid. We present the design and microarchitecture of BTS, including a network-on-chip design that exploits a deterministic communication pattern. BTS shows 5,556\texttimes{} and 1,306\texttimes{} improved execution time on ResNet-20 and logistic regression over a CPU, with a chip area of 373.6mm2 and up to 163.2W of power.}

The importance of these workloads motivates larger video processing infrastructures and – with the slowing of Moore’s law – specialized hardware accelerators to deliver more computing at higher efficiencies. This paper describes the design and deployment, at scale, of a new accelerator targeted at warehouse-scale video transcoding. We present our hardware design including a new accelerator building block – the video coding unit (VCU) – and discuss key design trade-offs for balanced systems at data center scale and co-designing accelerators with large-scale distributed software systems. We evaluate these accelerators “in the wild" serving live data center jobs, demonstrating 20-33x improved efficiency over our prior well-tuned non-accelerated baseline. Our design also enables effective adaptation to changing bottlenecks and improved failure management, and new workload capabilities not otherwise possible with prior systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discuss video acceleration at scale in large warehouse-scale environments.}

  abstract  = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

  abstract   = {The recently released SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite has already started receiving a lot of attention from both industry and academic communities. However, due to the significantly high size and complexity of the benchmarks, simulating all the CPU2017 benchmarks for design trade-off evaluation is likely to become extremely difficult. Simulating a randomly selected subset, or a random input set, may result in misleading conclusions. This paper analyzes the SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks using performance counter based experimentation from seven commercial systems, and uses statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and clustering to identify similarities among benchmarks. Such analysis can reveal benchmark redundancies and identify subsets for researchers who cannot use all benchmarks in pre-silicon design trade-off evaluations. Many of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks have been replaced with larger and complex workloads in the SPEC CPU2017 suite. However, compared to CPU2006, it is unknown whether SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks have different performance demands or whether they stress machines differently. Additionally, to evaluate the balance of CPU2017 benchmarks, we analyze the performance characteristics of CPU2017 workloads and compare them with emerging database, graph analytics and electronic design automation (EDA) workloads. This paper provides the first detailed analysis of SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite for the architecture community.},
