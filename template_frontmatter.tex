%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
\begin{dedication}
  To Olivia, my mom, and my late father
\end{dedication}


% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.

%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.

%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.

% \end{mydedication}



%% EPIGRAPH
%
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.
%
% \begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
%   \emph{A careful quotation\\
%   conveys brilliance.}\\
%   ---Smarty Pants
% \end{epigraph}

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.

%% ABSTRACT
%
%  Doctoral dissertation abstracts should not exceed 350 words.
%   The abstract may continue to a second page if necessary.
%
\begin{abstract}
  The dissertation investigates redundant communication between servers for large-scale web and cache requests and redundant data movement between accelerators for compute-intensive applications. 
  %
  Redundancy is an impending and critical issue for data centers designed for hardware accelerators and disaggregated resources. 
  %
  The dissertation makes the following three contributions to address this. The first contribution of the dissertation is \daronpon. 
  %
  \daronpon dynamically load-balances and reroutes large-scale requests of web and cache applications on a microsecond timescale. 
  %
  \daronpon prevents these requests, stranded on busy servers with network congestion and long queuing delays, from being processed. Daronpon shows improvement in various service time characterizations of different applications.
  %
  The second contribution of the dissertation is \dmx. 
  %
  \dmx acts as a compute-enabled bypass for inter-accelerator communication. 
  %
  \dmx accelerates the data restructuring needed between accelerators and saves the data movement between accelerators and CPUs for compute-intensive applications.
  %
  \dmx shows improvement in a series of benchmarks involving different application domains.
  %
  The third contribution of the dissertation is \aurelia. 
  %
  \aurelia leverages the emerging interconnect of CXL to investigate the design of a scalable fabric for accelerators and fabric-attached memory expansion.
  %
  \aurelia improves routing and transport based on the current specification of CXL and shows performance improvement on machine learning and key-value store applications.
