abstract = {Recent work introduced load-balancing algorithms that dynamically pick the best path entirely in the data plane, to react to traffic dynamics on a small timescale. This paper takes the next step to balance load dynamically across multiple paths in the data plane. The design of such a load-balancing primitive raises interesting challenges due to the hardware constraints of the data plane. We show that these constraints create practical problems for Weighted-Cost MultiPath (WCMP), which replicates hash-table entries in proportion to the weight of each path. Under these hardware constraints, na\"{\i}ve implementations of WCMP take a long time to converge to new weights. We then present a hash-based data structure that achieves adaptive traffic splitting in programmable data planes. Our data structure carefully partitions the arithmetic operations required to a) split traffic in proportion to the path weights and b) update the path weights, by leveraging a multi-stage pipeline and stateful ALUs. By doing so, accurate splitting and efficient updates are done at line rate. We implement our data structure in P4 and our preliminary evaluation shows significant reduction in flow completion time compared to other data-plane load-balancing schemes such as HULA.},

abstract = {Today's data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Non-uniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from today's higher-end solutions. Our approach requires no modifications to the end host network interface, operating system, or applications; critically, it is fully backward compatible with Ethernet, IP, and TCP.},
